I'm sure Victor Lewis-Smith will remind us once again of the drink and the under-age girlfriend, but I'm sadder about John Peel's death than I have been about any other celeb who has died in the last few years.

Partly it was the avuncular personality that made you feel that you know him, but also that he was a fixture in my life from an early age. He was always there and now he's gone. Like losing a relative.
