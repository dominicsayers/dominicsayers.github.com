I've been trying to find a source of data on cricket's Decision Review System (DRS or UDRS for Umpire Decision Review System). I have failed so far to find any raw data, having politely emailed or tweeted every cricket journalist and statistician I can find. Not one of them bothered to reply.

Cricinfo's statistician has produced some analysis of the DRS at the 2011 World Cup <a href="https://j.mp/fQG3Un" target="_blank">here</a>.

Individual umpires' performance is given as follows:
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Umpire</strong></td>
<td><strong>Reviews</strong></td>
<td><strong>Appeal rejected</strong></td>
<td><strong>Correct (%)</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>Aleem Dar</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>100.00</td>

<td>Billy Bowden</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>100.00</td>

<td>88.89</td>

<td>Shavir Tarapore</td>

Clearly there is no embargo on giving out this information. I thought this might have been one of the reasons the data was being kept hidden. And there's no surprises here to anybody familiar with international cricket. The idea that Daryl Harper could be replaced by a coin-tossing machine will raise no eyebrows.

If anybody knows where I can get (or buy) the data to support this on an ongoing basis please let me know.
