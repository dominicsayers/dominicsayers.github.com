<p>Now I've come out of the closet as a tagger I need to review my blogging platform. This post can't be categorised (as far as I know) because Blogger doesn't support it.</p>
<p>This seems odd. I don't particularly want to move to another platform, but the Blogger environment hasn't moved forward for as long as I can remember. Time to have a rethink.</p>
<p>On a similar subject, I have been in correspondence with a British author who has a blog on Amazon Connect. For those who don't know, this is a service on the Amazon US website where an author can connect to his audience by blogging. Comments are allowed only from people who have bought stuff on amazon.com (bad luck if you don't live in America and you've only bought stuff on amazon.co.uk - you don't get to comment).</p>
<p>The Amazon Connect blogs don't support syndication!. That's right - no RSS or ATOM feed from the blogs at all. This is by design - Amazon sure as hell understands syndication. They just don't want you consuming their authors' blogs without looking at their marketing alongside.</p>
<p>I won't identify the author in question until the conversation has come to some sort of conclusion. He is reviewing the situation at the moment.
