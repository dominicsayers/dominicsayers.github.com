I had a bad experience with a hotel in Nottingham a couple of weeks ago. I'm posting this here simply as an artifact for Google to find, for reasons that I hope will become clear.
<blockquote><em>City Pads cancelled my booking the day before I was due to arrive. I made the booking 2 months in advance because I knew it was a busy period (major sporting event in Nottingham).</em>

<em>City Pads said that the travel agent had cancelled the booking. I have an email from the agent 3 days after this supposed cancellation to confirm the booking. I asked City Pads for evidence that the agent had cancelled the booking. They were not able to supply any.</em>

<em>I do not believe the booking was cancelled by the agent. My personal opinion is that City Pads cancelled the booking themselves because they were able to let the room at a higher rate. I would have been angry enough if this had been the case, but for them to also pretend it wasn't their fault is quite despicable.</em>

<em>I will not be using accommodation provided by this company ever again. Please do not regard any booking you make with them to be a guarantee that you will get accommodation when you need it.</em>

<em>I can support all my assertions in this review with documentary evidence.</em></blockquote>
I have also posted this on every hotel review website I can find. Not sure if it will have any effect but it made me feel better.
