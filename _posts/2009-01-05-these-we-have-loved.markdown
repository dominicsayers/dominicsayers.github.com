It's traditional at this time of year to list all the dear departed from the past 12 months. I profoundly regret the loss of two websites that were the source of considerable unproductivity for me:

<a href="http://www.accidentallight.com" target="_blank">Accidental Light</a>

Malcolm Dick's faux naif blog could have been so much more. I'm sure he has more to say but perhaps he has chosen another medium in which to say it. Perhaps he is simply too busy. Malcolm: if you read this let me know where I can follow your inquiries.

<a href="http://www.ludgatecircus.com" target="_blank">Ludgate Circus</a>

A website that hit several of myÂ sweet spots: the City of London, the construction industry, beer and middle-aged grumpiness. Ludgate Circus tracked the ongoing transformation of the City's diversity into a concrete and glass wilderness, meticulously documenting all the construction projects in and around the square mile. As an aside it also described most of the eateries and drinkeries in the City too - a considerable personal achievement on the part of its anonymous author.

If either of these projects resurrects itself I would be grateful for a tip-off.

Aaaargh! Matt Jones has disappeared too. I guess Dopplr and Howies are keeping him a bit busy to wibble on about other stuff.
