Here is Simon Hughes talking about (and to) Adil Rashid, the young Yorkshire leg-spinner: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mediaplayer.telegraph.co.uk/?item=325d5abb-89f6-4bf6-993e-9c8a2a893667">Scouting for England: Adil Rashid</a>.

He doesn't appear to give it much a rip at the moment, so his principal weapons seem to be flight and accuracy. This should be plenty good enough for county cricket and I don't think he would look out of place in a Test Match even now. It is to his advantage at the moment that he is playing batsmen who have not seen him before. Next season may be a better time to assess his potential for greatness, when he is bowling at good batsmen who have plenty of video evidence and prior experience to rely on.

There is no reason why he could not go on to be a regular international, but Yorkshire's policy of careful management of his development is surely the right one. The other day county caps were awarded to two newcomers to the team (Younis Khan and Jacques Rudolph) but not Rashid, even though he has played more first team games then either of them. Nothing should be read into this other than that Yorkshire are wary of him getting a big 'ead. Plus ca change.
