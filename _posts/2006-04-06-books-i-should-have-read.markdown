<p>For no other reason than self-flagellation I'm going to start a list of books I should have read. Hopefully this will provoke me to get on with it. Worse, I have copies of some of these and have still not got round to reading them. I will also note the must-read books I started then gave up on.</p>
<p>Some of these may date quickly. If I'd been compiling this list in the 70s I would probably feel I had to read The One-Minute Manager and stuff like that. Hey, there's another list! Books that are no longer required reading! The Mythical Man-Month, Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus, etc. etc. If I procrastinate long enough many of the books on my list will drop off due to no longer being trendy (No Logo springs to mind as a candidate).</p>
<p>How can I manage this list? I would like other people to prioritise them for me since I am unlikely to be able to read them all anytime soon. Which do you recommend?</p>
<p>Where is the <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> for books?</p>
