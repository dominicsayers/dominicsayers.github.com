I <a href="https://dominicsayers.blogspot.com/2006/03/user-experience.html">documented</a> my problems with an Acer Media Center box. For the record, I found somebody on eBay selling the particular wire I needed, ordered it, installed it and was able to complete the setup with no problem.

I am still angry that I had to do this merely to get Sky working with Media Center, but now I have a back catalog of West Wing, Green Wing, the Daily Show and Sports Night episodes that I can watch to console myself.
