You can put away your videos of Botham's Ashes, never mind anything featuring Andrew Flintoff. England's greatest-ever all-rounder is...Tim Bresnan. The figures don't lie:
<table border="0" frame="VOID" rules="NONE" cellspacing="0"><colgroup> <col width="104" /> <col width="110" /> <col width="117" /></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="LEFT" width="104" height="18"></td>
<td align="RIGHT" width="110">Batting average</td>
<td align="RIGHT" width="117">Bowling average</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="LEFT" height="19">Tim Bresnan</td>
<td align="RIGHT">45.42</td>
<td align="RIGHT">23.60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="LEFT" height="18">Ian Botham</td>
<td align="RIGHT">33.55</td>
<td align="RIGHT">28.40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="LEFT" height="18">Andrew Flintoff</td>
<td align="RIGHT">31.78</td>
<td align="RIGHT">32.79</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

And don't forget, Bresnan's figures have been achieved in an Ashes series in Australia and a series against the world's No.1 team at the time: India.

Footnotes:

1. He doesn't yet qualify for my World's Greatest All-rounders table (<a href="https://cricdata.org/players/xfactor">https://cricdata.org/players/xfactor</a>) because he has neither 500 runs nor 50 wickets. But he will

2. If you look at the table, England's greatest all-rounders are actually Ted Dexter and Tony Greig. But who cares about them?
