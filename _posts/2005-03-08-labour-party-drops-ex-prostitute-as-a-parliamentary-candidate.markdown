...or does it?

From the "more to it than meets the eye" department. I was all set to be outraged at the Labour Party bowing to the morals of the Daily Mail tendency when my spidey senses started tingling. Could it really be true that the Labour Party dropped Christine Wheatley as a candidate just because she admitted working as a prostitute in Paris in the 1970s?

Just as I suspected there were plenty of other factors at work here. The <a href="http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=183120">local paper pointed out that she was a bit of a loony</a> when the shortlist was first announced. Remember this is a pretty safe seat; it was Jack Cunningham's Copeland constituency in the North West.

Christine Wheatley was shortlisted only because of the Labour Party's positive discrimination rules: if there are any female candidates for the shortlist at least one has to be selected. Christine Wheatley was the only female applicant so she had to be included however weak a candidate she was.

The local officials say she was deselected because she failed to tell them about her former employment when she applied. You can see their point. The Labour Party is justifiably accused of control freakery, but it kind of makes sense to tell your party officials about anything in your past as politically sensitive as having been a prostitute. Properly spun it could have been a positive factor, but Ms Wheatley blurted it out in an interview with a local newspaper and the damage was done.

If the <a href="http://money.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=WE0HL0W0AGUUDQFIQMGSM5WAVCBQWJVC?xml=/news/2005/02/25/ntart25.xml&amp;secureRefresh=true&amp;_requestid=7098">Telegraph story</a> is to be believed she believes in some natural path to eternal life, but also that the Queen is out to get her. An ideal Labour Party candidate, really.
