If I was writing a sports book and there was a existing sports author<span style="color:#888888;">[2]</span> with the same name as me I would urgently consider changing my pen name.

If I was was writing a book about cricket and I had the same name as a famous cricketer<span style="color:#888888;">[3]</span>, I might consider the game was up and I had better start thinking of pseudonyms right away.
