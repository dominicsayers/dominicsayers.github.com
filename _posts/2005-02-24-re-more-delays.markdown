<p class="mobile-post">From the "you couldn't make it up" department.</p>

<p class="mobile-post">Having waited an hour and a half for Mr Bush to depart on Air Force One,
they finally bussed us out to the waiting plane and got us seated. Time to
go home. Hurrah!
</p><p class="mobile-post">Of course it wasn't.</p>

<p class="mobile-post">Now we are sitting here waiting for the de-icer. Deja vu etc. The captain
has announced it will be at least an hour's wait, which makes the Heathrow
de-icers look positively efficient. Maybe there is only one de-icer in the
whole of northern Europe.

</p><p class="mobile-post">Leaving aside the question of why they couldn't get on with the de-icing
while we were comfortably sitting in the lounge with a cold beer, why don't
they have heated flaps on these planes? Surely it would be cheaper to switch
on the heaters for a few minutes than to pay the airport facility fee?
</p><p class="mobile-post">Too simple, probably. Oh no, I sound like the Daily Mail.</p>
