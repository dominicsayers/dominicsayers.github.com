<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dopplr.com">Dopplr</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a>?

All the cool kids use Dopplr. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/">Blackbelt Jones</a> is a team member and I am a fan.

On the other hand, I can just forward my email confirmations to TripIt and <strong>it does everything for me</strong>!

1-0 to TripIt at the moment*.

* Except my emails from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flymonarch.com/">Monarch Airlines</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thomsonfly.com">Thomsonfly</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalexpresseastcoast.com/">National Express East Coast</a> weren't recognised. So maybe 0.5-0
