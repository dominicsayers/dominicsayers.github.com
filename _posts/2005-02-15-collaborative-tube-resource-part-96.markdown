I forgot a hugely important resource for information about particular tube stations (and everything else as well of course: wikipedia.

The excellent entry for my example station Embankment is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embankment_tube_station">here</a>. Not every station is covered, but many are.

I would hope that http://www.mytube.org would be less like a reference book and more like a Rough Guide to the station and the area round it. Wikipedia and MyTube can coexist happily because they serve different purposes.

What wikipedia really needs, though, is the clickable tube map I am working on. That would give it a focal point for tube information that isn't beholden to TfL copyright restrictions.
