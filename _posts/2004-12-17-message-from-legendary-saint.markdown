Thank you to Saint Frideswide, who commented on my bicycle light post to point out that people who ride two bicycles might need a spare set of brackets so they only have to carry one set of lights.

This is a fair point but I suggest it is only a minority of people who are able to ride two bicycles. But I suppose if you are a saint then miracles are easy.
