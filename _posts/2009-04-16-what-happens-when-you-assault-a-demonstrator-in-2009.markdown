<a href="https://blog.dominicsayers.com/2009/04/14/taking-photographs-of-police-officers/" target="_blank">I posted yesterday</a> about the value of photographing (and filming) police officers as a way of encouraging them to stay within their legal operating constraints. Since no action has been taken against police officers involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_G-20_London_summit" target="_blank">G20</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_G-20_London_summit_protests" target="_blank">demonstrations</a> <em>except</em> whenÂ they were being filmed we can conclude one of two things:
<ol>
	<li>No police officer acted inappropriately except the ones that were caught on film, or</li>
	<li>Police officers are rarely disciplined unless they are caught in an inappropriate act by a member of the public or a journalist</li>
</ol>
If the first is true then that in itself is a testament to the value of universal public documentation of demonstrations. I sincerely hope this is the answer, not the second option.

At 3:50 in the above video a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Support_Group" target="_blank">Territorial Support Group</a> officer uses his armoured glove to hit a woman in the face. He then hits her with his baton. Don't watch the assault, it's not very edifying. Instead watch the forest of cameras that appear as soon as he starts to attack the woman.

The officer has now been suspended. Who thinks this would have happened without those cameras?

Who thinks that adding "constables" to <a href="https://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080028_en_9#pt7-pb3-l1g76" target="_blank">Section 76 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008</a> was a good idea?
