Finally got round to reading the latest chapter of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001Xr&amp;topic_id=1">Beautiful Evidence</a>. This is what I wrote as a comment:

"Beauty is Truth, and Truth Beauty" (John Keats, I think).

As your other correspondents have pointed out, and as my Physics teacher at school often said, there is definitely beauty in the elegant exposition of a scientific idea.


The Rock/Braque/Picasso sequence, on the other hand, relies on the other half of the Keats statement. It is definitely beautiful but I am not sure what the point is. However, if we believe Keats, the obvious beauty of the sequence must conceal a truth somewhere!
