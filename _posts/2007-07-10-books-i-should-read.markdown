<p class="desc">Another plea then: how do people read so much? My journey to work is short so I can just about read The Economist in a week. At work I do work. At home I attend to my family. I don't watch television or have a hobby or do anything that could be displaced in favour of reading.</p>
<p class="desc">How do you manage it?</p>
<p class="desc">Footnote: these lists are now on del.icio.us - <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/booksishouldhaveread">Books I should have read</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/bookstoread">books to read</a>. In the spirit of JP's NewTailBlog meme, perhaps other people could use the same tag for their lists and see what happens when we aggregate the lists.</p>
