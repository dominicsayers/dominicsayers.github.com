It would appear that I am the only Dominic Sayers with any sort of internet presence. Not that I Google myself at all. Oh no.

Until now I have been quite relaxed about this, to the extent that I have not bothered to stake my own little bit of DNS space by registering dominicsayers.com.

But it appears I may soon have to because I have been joined by another Dominic Sayers. Only <a href="https://www.karenkendall.com/books.php">this one</a> is supposedly fictional (although the character in forthcoming bonkbuster "The Man-Handlers" is clearly based on me being described as an "alpha male"). All I can say is that Jane O'Toole (or Plenty as I call her) has taken on more than she can handle.

The sheer unlikelihood of an author coming up with this name by chance leads me to believe that either I am known to "Karen Kendall" or she gets her character names by random internet surfing. Something fishy here but I can't put my finger on it.
