The issue tracking systems I have seen assume you are going to use the issue tracker to manage the tasks needed to resolve the issues. The project management systems I have used assume you are going to proactively inform the stakeholders of the project progress in a general way.

I have yet to see an issue tracking system that can interface with a project management system in such a way that many issues in the issue tracking system can be linked to a single task in the project management system. This would mean that when a task is completed all the issues that relate to it can be closed. When the people who raised the issues ask for a status report and a completion date you can just give them the scheduled completion date for that task from the project management system (plus six weeks obviously :-)).
