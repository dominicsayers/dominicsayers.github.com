Despite fears of electoral fraud spread by people like Michael Moore and the EFF, there seems to be little anecdotal evidence of widespread voting problems in the US elections.

Michael Moore's appeal on his <a href="https://www.michaelmoore.com/">website</a> for stories of voting problems hasn't resulted in any substantive contributions.

Other blogs I have seen with voting stories have largely been praising the way the election was conducted.

Even <a href="https://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/02/heartwarning_paper_v.html">Cory Doctorow</a> has some positive stories.

The antis will probably claim it was their vigilance that prevented any serious fraud. Maybe it was.
