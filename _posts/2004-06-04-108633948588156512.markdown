<a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2004/06/i_found_leo_say.html">I found Leo Sayer's phone number</a>
<p>Trying a shirt on in Selfridge's the other day, I noticed a scrap of paper on the floor. Looking closer, I realised it wasn't attached to my prospective shirt but must have previously fallen off some other garment. Looking closer still, I realised it had <a href="http://www.leosayer.com/">Leo Sayer's</a> mobile phone number written on it.</p>
<p><img alt="Leo Sayer's number scribbled on a Selfridge's receipt" border="0" height="562" src="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/files/leosayer.jpg" width="400"/></p>
<p>You'll note I've deployed the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/crimewatch/index.shtml">Crimewatch</a> filter in Photoshop to pixellate the number.</p>
<p>Now there could be several Leo Sayers out there, but I doubt there are many. Even in a city of 12m+, I reckon there's only one Leo Sayer. Only one Leo Sayer likely to be in the men's clothing department of Selfridge's ... So imagine the sheer visceral thrill of holding the mobile number of the man personally responsible for monster hits "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" (No.2 Oct 1976) and "When I Need You" (No.1 Jan 1977). <a href="http://www.leosayer.com/discography.html">Amongst others</a>. <em>Visceral</em>, I tell you.</p>
<p><em>[Have to say, it doesn't reflect awfully well on Selfridge's understanding of personal privacy ... another twist on the old adage about your credit card number being more likely to ripped off via restaurant receipts than from the internet ...]</em></p>
<p>Obviously, after vaguely wondering about how much I'd get for it on eBay and then briefly toying with the idea of giving him a ring (just to mess with his mind), I've decided to respect Mr. Sayer's privacy by destroying the original - so don't try to get in touch, Leo-fans. Boy, is this going to generate some confused looking arrivals referred from Google ...</p>
