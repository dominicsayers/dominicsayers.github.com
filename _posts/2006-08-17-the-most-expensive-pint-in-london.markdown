This is real.

And, credit where it's due, she said this with a straight face as she gave me my drink. If this was a bar in a West End hotel then I might not be surprised at the price. But it isn't, it's a regular bar in the City. It's not as if there aren't plenty of other bars in EC2, some charging as little as £3 a pint. There weren't even any celebrities in there.

The most shocking thing is that the VAT on this drink is more than the entire price of a pint back in my student union days in Gower Street.
