Downside of sending blog entries from my Blackberry:

(1) Because it goes through the email system at work, the standard corporate disclaimer that gets added to all emails from the office gets appended to the post. I've spoken to the messaging team and they are working on a workaround.

(2) Formatting. Some component of the email system puts in line breaks at around 75 characters. This looks fine in my news aggregator, but looks shit on the Blogspot web page representation of the blog.

I've decided not to change the formatting but I have removed the email disclaimer. I don't want to explicitly say who I work for on this blog, although it probably wouldn't be too hard for you to find out if you wanted to make the effort.
