<a target="_blank" href="http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1717/">Richard Rutter</a> has come up with a better phrase to describe the <a target="_blank" href="http://dominicsayers.wordpress.com/2006/06/02/social-opml/#comment-36">Read/Not Read status</a> of a feed item. He just calls it "item status". That will do for me from now on.

He chose <a target="_blank" href="http://shrook.com/">Shrook</a> as his aggregator because it supported synchronisation of item status between environments back in 2004. Unfortunately it's just a Mac client.

However, it's good to have company in recognising this is a valuable feature.
