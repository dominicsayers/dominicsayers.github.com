Your last chance to see <a href="https://www.newcityarchitecture.com">this exhibition </a>before it closes on 2nd July. Features models of <a href="https://www.newcityarchitecture.com/exhibitiongallery/exhibitiongallery1.html">all the new towers </a>planned for the square mile, including 51 Lime Street where I see from my office window they have started demolishing the old building this week.
