Forgot an obvious one:

1. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349113467/qid=1144307770/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/026-4754653-6799626">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a>, Malcolm Gladwell
2. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141014598/qid=1144307770/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/026-4754653-6799626">Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</a>, Malcolm Gladwell
3. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349116059/qid=1144307770/sr=8-3/ref=pd_ka_3/026-4754653-6799626">The Wisdom of Crowds</a>, James Surowiecki
<strong>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cathedral-Bazaar-Eric-S-Raymond/dp/0596001088/sr=8-1/qid=1163756617/ref=sr_1_1/203-3345198-4683111?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</a>, Eric S. Raymond</strong>

And there's also a short list of books I thought I should read but got annoyed with and threw across the room, starting with:

1. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Logo-Naomi-Klein/dp/0006530400/sr=1-1/qid=1163756821/ref=sr_1_1/203-3345198-4683111?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">No Logo</a>, Naomi Klein

Irritating beyond belief.

Of course I haven't got anywhere near reading anything from the top list although I did buy The Tipping Point. Now gathering dust on the side table that is the physical embodiment of the Books I Should Have Read list.
