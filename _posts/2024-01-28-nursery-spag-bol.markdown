    heading: Variations
    steps:
      - Simply omit the meat for a delicious pasta sauce or pizza topping.
      - This recipe works well with Quorn mince (or similar). Fry it up like the meat but use copious olive oil to make up for the taste lost by not using meat. Like 50-100ml of olive oil if you can afford it.

<!--excerpt.start-->
This is how I make spag bol for my kids, who are slightly fussy eaters
<!--excerpt.end-->

This works without the meat as a pasta sauce or as pizza topping.

My sister's children eat healthy Mediterranean food with relish. My own children refused to eat anything with visible ingredients. The worst thing you can give them is food that "pops" in your mouth like peas, beans or onion pieces.

So in order to get them to eat a spag bol it was necessary to remove any visible obstacles. Hence my "nursery" spag bol, which is a delicious full-flavoured sauce with no hurdles to tea-time consumption.
