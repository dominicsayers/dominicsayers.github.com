<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cominded.com/paulbirch/index.html">Paul Birch</a> hasÂ a list of books that he calls "insightful". I assume he has read them.

I was interested to see all six of my "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dominicsayers.com/tag/off-topic/books/">Books I should Have Read</a>" list on there. Perhaps I should aspire to read the others in his list too?
