If you are an Economist reader you will probably appreciate the apology at the bottom of p108 of the November 3rd edition, which I nearly missed:
<blockquote>In our review last week of Lucien Polastron's book on libraries we said that Augustus had destroyed the Alexandrian library in 48BC. Since the lad, then called Octavian, was only 15 at the time, he obviously didn't. And Julius Caesar, who did, hadn't actually meant to. We apologise to Mr Polastron, the many well-educated readers who have complained, and to Augustus, now divine.</blockquote>
I wasn't one of the readers who pointed this out to them, although the date and the Egyptian connection might have suggested Julius was the more likely Caesar, but I feel the divine Augustus and his relatives are surely Economist subscribers and will appreciate the apology.
