Finally, the killer app that syndication has been waiting for!

You can now get <a href="https://www.ecb.co.uk/live-scores.xml">syndicated cricket score updates</a> from the <a href="https://www.ecb.co.uk/">ECB website</a> (in RSS 0.91 for syndication nerds).

Why is this important? Well if you have to ask then you'll never know, as Louis Armstrong once said.

I am evaluating this feed right now and I will post a consumer report soon. Unfortunately I discovered it too late for the England game that finished yesterday, so I had to slip down to the pub to catch the excitement of the last two wickets.
