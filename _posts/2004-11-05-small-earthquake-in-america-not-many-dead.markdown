There have been some reports of US election shenanigans on the blogs, but if there had been any serious fraud then I think the volume would have been much louder by now.

<a href="https://www.it-director.com/article.php?id=12369&amp;zz=7662e3a9aa545">Here</a> is an article by Robin Bloor of Bloor Research that pretty much sums up my opinion of the election process. This doesn't, by the way, mean that I endorse Robin Bloor wholesale - I think he is a media tart and wrong about a lot of things. But that doesn't mean I have to disagree with everything he says.
