Another idea: if I or somebody else draws a diagram of the London Underground network and releases it under a Creative Commons license, this would get around the TfL copyright on the official tube map.

I could then use this as the clickable map on the front of the MyTube.org site.

How different would it have to be from the Harry Beck design in order to be safe from TfL?
