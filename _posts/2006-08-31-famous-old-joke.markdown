I've been looking for a copy of this image for a while. Click the image for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=229865517&amp;size=o" target="_blank">slightly bigger version</a> if you can't read the text.

I first remember seeing it when I was a junior developer back in the Thatcher era. I'm pretty sure it was long in the tooth then.

Two things about it:

1. We still get the joke today. Worse, it is still true for some projects today. Why haven't we fixed this yet?

2. Does anybody know where this originated? Who wrote/drew it and where was it first published?

3. How can search I the internet to find copies of this image?

OK, that's three things.
