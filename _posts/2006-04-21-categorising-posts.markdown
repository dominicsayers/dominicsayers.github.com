I have moved <a href="https://dominicsayers.wordpress.com" title="Dominic Sayers">my blog</a> from Blogger to <a href="https://wordpress.com/" title="Wordpress" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> because I think it&#39;s important to categorise my posts and Blogger doesn&#39;t allow me to do that.

When I say important I mean, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpty_dumpty#Exploitation" target="_blank">Humpty Dumpty</a>, something quite specific and possibly not all the senses of the word important are covered by my move to Wordpress. Coverage of my move in The Times has been limited for example.

Important because I have said in previous posts that tagging has value. If I believe this then I should tag my posts. And here I can and will do so.
