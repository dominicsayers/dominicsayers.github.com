The building known as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ludgatecircus.com/1_new_change.htm">1 New Change</a> has been demolished, exposing a view of St Paul's Cathedral that hasn't been seen since 1958. The replacement building will be started very soon so this is a fleeting view that you won't see again in your lifetime:

From my Flickr set <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dominicsayers/collections/72157600882111941/">here</a>. The details of the death of the old 1 New Change are from the excellent <a href="http://www.ludgatecircus.com/">www.ludgatecircus.com</a>, an idiosyncratic guide to EC4.
