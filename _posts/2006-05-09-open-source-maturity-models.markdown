<p>In Bill Hilf's <a href="http://port25.technet.com/archive/2006/05/08/2417.aspx" target="_blank">latest post</a> from his somewhat counter-intuitive position as head of Microsoft's open source laboratory, he mentions a Carnegie Mellon West initiative called <a href="http://www.openbrr.org/docs/BRR_whitepaper_2005RFC1.pdf" target="_blank">OpenBRR</a>. This is an attempt to assess the business-readiness of open source software. In other words, if you want to adopt a particular piece of open source software in your enterprise, how ready is it for a production system?</p>
<p>To quote from the introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p><cite>There is no widely used model for evaluation. This complicates open source adoption, as companies assessing open source software can rarely learn from each otherâ€™s experiences.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair point, but is a formal standard the answer to this problem? It seems like there is already a lot of formality about open source development because you are replacing a closely-knit development team with a looser congregation of individuals and the only way to manage this is by having high-quality source code management processes. So in that sense, some formality from the user side fits nicely with the supply side disciplines.</p>
<p>On the other hand, open source development is supposed to be a new paradigm for a new era. Is it right to hamper it with old-school technology evaluation methods? The OpenBRR proposal builds on two existing maturity models, Navica's <a href="http://www.navicasoft.com/pages/osmm.htm" target="_blank">Open Source Maturity Model</a> and Cap Gemini's <a href="http://www.seriouslyopen.org/nuke/html/index.php" target="_blank">equivalent</a>. The target audience for these processes seems to be decision-makers who would be more comfortable buying big iron from IBM.</p>
<p>The OpenBRR specification is not bad in itself. In my organisation we used a very similar proces for evaluating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Management" target="_blank">BPM</a> software not so long ago. We faced the same challenges: (1) reducing a large number of potential vendors down to a manageable shortlist and (2) making sure our efforts were shared and available to other technology teams to prevent them having to go through the same expensive and time-consuming exercise themselves.</p>
<p>In this respect the process was no different between open source and traditional vendors. An open approach to sharing these results is a great idea, but I'm not sure it needs anything other than a public wiki to do so.
