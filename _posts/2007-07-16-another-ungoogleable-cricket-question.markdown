<a target="_blank" href="http://www.accidental-light.com/">Malcolm</a>'s leet Google skillz proved me wrong last time, but I guess it's a good way to find the answer to a question I <em>don't</em> know the answer to. Let's find out.

Back in 1984, a tall left-handed opening batsman made his debut for England against the West Indies, the best team in the world at the time. He made only one 50 in the series (in his first innings) and was dropped for the whole of 1985 in favour of a journeyman from Nottingham called Tim Robinson. Recalled for the 1986/87 Ashes series in Australia, he scored three centuries and was one of the architects of England's Ashes series victory, which remains the most recent occasion when England have won the Ashes in Australia. <a target="_blank" href="http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/9230.html">Chris Broad</a> (for it was he) has a son who may well make his Test match debut against India on Thursday.

Now during Broad senior's spell in the wilderness in 1985, a bluff Yorkshireman called <a target="_blank" href="http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/20185.html">Arnie Sidebottom</a> played his one and only Test Match, taking 1 for 65 and limping off injured. His son has also played Test cricket and looked like joining him as a one-Test wonder until being recalled this year.

Assuming both <a target="_blank" href="http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/10617.html">Stuart Broad</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/20187.html">Ryan Sidebottom</a> are selected in the XI for Thursday, is this the only time that two players in the England team are the sons of former Test players? I think it may be.

Has this happened for other countries? I don't know that either, but the network of cousins and nephews who have played for India and Pakistan certainly makes it possible. Richard Hadlee's father played for New Zealand but I don't know if any of his team mates' fathers also played.

Any ideas? <a target="_blank" href="http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/14127.html">Dean Headley</a> doesn't count double despite being both the son and grandson of former Test players. Also, considering the four hairstyles linked to above, I am finding Arnie Sidebottom the most likely role model for me so long as I don't have to copy his facial expression.
