<p>In line with this blog getting a teensy bit more serious, I've updated the blogroll on the right to include a couple of blogs I read for stimulation rather than amusement.</p>
<p>New additions will continue to appear, but today's are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.confusedofcalcutta.com/">Confused of Calcutta</a>, a blog about information by a clever man with whom I have had the privilege of working.<br />
<a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/">City of Sound</a> by Dan Hill, Head of Interactive Technology  and Design at some part of the BBC, who makes me think about stuff that would otherwise fly past on the other side of the stream.
