  Instructions:
    - Preheat the oven to 150C fan.
    - Line a large baking tin with baking parchment (my tin measures 39cm x 26cm).
    - Melt the butter and sugar in a large pan over a low heat. Don't cook the butter, just warm it enough to melt it.
    - Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the condensed milk.
    - Mix in the oats until well coated by the mixture.
    - Pour into the baking tin and smooth out with the back of a large spoon.
    - Cook for about 15-20 minutes. When the flapjack starts to brown around the edges of the tin, take it out of the oven - it should still be relatively pale in the middle.
    - Leave to cool for a few minutes before cutting into pieces.

This recipe makes enough flapjack for two hungry children for several weeks of school lunches.

The best thing about this recipe (as well as the fact that it makes a delicious, moist flapjack) is that it _needs no measuring_! The ingredients are all whole packets or tins - no need for any weighing or cutting.

The ingredients can be thought of like this:

* 2 packets of porridge oats
* 1 tin of condensed milk
* 1 bag of soft brown sugar
* 2 packs of butter

The quantities and exact type of the ingredients isn't crucial to the recipe - flapjack is very forgiving. I often use up crusty old honey jars instead of some of the sugar - you can soften the honey by putting the jar in a pan of warm water for a while.

I often use salted butter because it's what we've got in the fridge, but if you're buying butter specially for this recipe then you might want to choose unsalted.
