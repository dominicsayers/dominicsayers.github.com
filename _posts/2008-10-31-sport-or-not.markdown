A friend, let us call him Mushy, <a href="https://mushysmumblings.wordpress.com/2007/02/04/why-golf-is-not-a-sport/" target="_self">defines</a> a sport as any activity that cannot be accomplished while smoking or wearing slacks. As a definition, this leaves something to be desired since clearly Synchronised Swimming is not a sport despite being a bit difficult to do while smoking or wearing slacks. <a href="https://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uu_qI4GbgM" target="_blank">Even in the office</a>.

The obvious Third Law of What Constitutes A Sport is that it has a clear result without resorting to subjective judgement. This neatly excludes Synchronised Swimming, Ice Skating, Ballroom Dancing and Ski Jumping so we are onto a winner.

Until now.

News has just reached me of a sport that cannot be practised while smoking and the wearing of slacks is prohibited by its Laws. Moreover, it has a clear winner: <a href="https://www.lflus.com/" target="_blank">everybody</a>.

I cannot decide whether this means Western society has now reached the acme of its achievements, or whether perhaps this is a clear sign that we are in a decadent spiral of decline. Here come the Goths!
