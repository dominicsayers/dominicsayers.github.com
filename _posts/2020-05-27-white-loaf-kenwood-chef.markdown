<!--excerpt.start-->
This is how I make an easy and quick white loaf using my kitchen mixer. It's trouble-free and reliable and a great time-saver.

I mentioned my Kenwood Chef by name because I know it works. Your mixer may be just as good so long as it has a dough hook.

There are longish gaps in this recipe while we wait for things to happen, like the yeast activating or the dough rising. You will find yourself with a spare egg yolk if you use the egg white I suggest in the ingredients. I now whip up a bowl of fresh mayonnaise with the egg yolk while I'm waiting for the next step in this recipe. I would never have learned how to make my own fresh mayonnaise had I not started baking bread with this recipe. By far the hardest work with this bread recipe is whisking the mayonnaise while you wait.

Here are the detailed steps. I've made each one easy and unambiguous, I hope.
