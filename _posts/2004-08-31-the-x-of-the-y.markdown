Headline writers get a feel for the rhythm of a phrase that has captured the zeitgeist. The controversy surrounding Mel Gibson's film The Passion Of The Christ means that its title is familiar to far more people than actually saw the film. So now the structure of the title is being used in headlines such as <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/08/31/rnc_day_one/">The Passion Of The Rudy</a> about Rudy Giuliani's address to the Republican National Convention in New York recently.

You can look forward to this form being used a lot from now on until it becomes such a cliche that it dies out. The same thing happened with the "brown is the new black" meme, which has now fortunately all but disappeared. The thing is, the form gets used just because it has a familiar ring to it. OK, with Rudy Giuliani's speech there is a tie-in with the word passion, but Christ's passion just means suffering and I believe the Salon writer was talking about a different sort of passion altogether.

Pretty soon the link with the original meaning will be lost altogether and we will get rubbish that just sounds similar to the film title. Just you wait.
