I did a sample page for the <a href="https://dominicsayers.blogspot.com/2005/02/tube-station-folksonomy.html">collaborative Tube resource idea</a> and put it up <a href="https://swpa.dnsalias.net:8088/sites/mytube/">here</a>.

It's pretty good content-wise but needs a lot of visual tweaking to make it nice. It also needs a method for enabling user contributions, and I guess a Wiki-based site would be the easiest way to make this happen.

Alea jacta est.

Oh and I bought the mytube.org domain. Network Solutions are supposed to be redirecting traffic to the sample site alrady but it seems to be broken at the moment so I'm not mentioning this for the moment.
