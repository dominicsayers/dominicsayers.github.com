I agree with the commonly-held belief that you shouldn&#39;t be taxed unless you are represented on the body that is taxing you. The Boston Tea Party was a worthy cause. However I also believe in the slightly less popular obverse argument. Why should you get a vote if you don&#39;t pay tax?

Yes I know this unfairly disenfranchises women, who often are bringing up children rather than paying tax. Maybe there could be some exceptions to my rule but I&#39;m talking about a general principle here.
