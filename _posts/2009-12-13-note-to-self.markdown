No really. Move along there's nothing to see here.

1. Herb Simon

2. Complex adaptive systems (esp. Nearly Decomposable systems)

3. Netflix mission statement

There's clearly some academic work supporting the "we hold these truths to be self-evident" tone of the Netflix mission statement slides. Do some reading. Do some writing. This stuff matters.

NB Remember to credit Sean for the Prezi.
