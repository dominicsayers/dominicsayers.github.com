If you're not a cricket follower you may have missed reports of Kevin  Pietersen's unusual feat in hitting two sixes in a recent match with a reversed  grip. In other words he turned himself into a left-handed batsman just before  the bowler bowled and scored a maximum not once but twice.

If you're not a cricket follower the rest of this article probably won't be  interesting anyway - move along, there's nothing to see. If you're interested  enough to want to know what I'm talking about, here's a video capture of KP's  coup de theatre:

Despite the furore surrounding this latest example, it's not a particularly  recent innovation. Here's a video of KP hitting Muttiah Muralitharan for six  with a reverse grip two years ago:

And again last year in the World Twenty-20:

It happened in a game I played in myself about twenty years ago. A batsman saw the opportunity to take advantage of a very short offside boundary by converting it into a legside boundary. He turned round and reversed his grip as the bowler ran in. The bowler saw him do it and tried to bounce him. The result: a perfect reverse pull for six. Magnificent. Thanks for the memory, Taffy.

If you still can't see what all the fuss is about, here's Sachin  Tendulkar playing a brilliant reverse sweep <em>without</em> altering his grip. This shot  has been around for a decade or more and any initial controversy has long since  died away. Indeed this shot is now taught by coaches, initially by the late Bob Woolmer in the 1990s.

BBC Cricket Correspondent Jonathan Agnew <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7456461.stm" target="_blank">believes</a> that the reversed grip  should be outlawed forthwith. And indeed the <a href="https://www.mcc.org.uk/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/" target="_blank">MCC</a> (the guardian of the game's  laws) is meeting today to discuss the matter and possibly act to prevent any  batsman from attempting it in the future.

If I may say so, this is entirely typical of both Agnew and the MCC. The MCC  failed to act on, or even notice, the new shot when it was introduced. Now they  are responding to a tabloid-style drama created by journalists such as Agnew.  I'm afraid I must add them to my <a href="https://www.dominicsayers.com/2008/04/17/worlds-worst-sports-governing-body/" target="_blank">list of low-quality sports governing  bodies</a>.

I think it's because a player is doing the innovating, rather than the governing body, that the response has been so negative in these quarters. Governing bodies are there to control and when innovation happens elsewhere it demonstrates how tissue-thin the veneer of control actually is. It is threatening and their reaction is understandable.

Nothing will happen as a result of the MCC's meeting today and I'll tell you why. Firstly, governing bodies are good at one thing and that's inertia. To change the law because of one player is almost unheard of (although <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=K65_spUU05s" target="_blank">Trevor Chappell</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyline" target="_blank">Harold Larwood</a> spring to mind because of their captains' instructions). But mostly because there is no mechanism for punishing a batsman except by dismissing him. To add "reversing the grip" to the other ten methods of dismissal would be a seismic overreaction.

Ungoogleable cricket question (I've tried): when were the ten methods of dismissal introduced? Were they all in the first set of Laws published? I don't know the answer but I'd like to.

Edited to add: I should have said this post was provoked by my former colleague JP's <a href="https://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/06/15/not-cricket-of-course-it-is" target="_blank">thoughts</a> on the subject.
