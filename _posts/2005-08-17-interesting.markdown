It appears I have taken the most "interesting" picture of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/fenchurchstreet/interesting/">Fenchurch Street</a> on Flickr. Not much of an achievement because there are only 6 photos of Fenchurch Street on the whole site.

I also have 4 of the top 10 most "interesting" pictures of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/portofspain/interesting/">Port of Spain</a>.

They announced the "<a href="https://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting">interestingness</a>" feature earlier this month I think, but <a href="https://whatilearned2day.blogspot.com/2005/08/fucking-with-flickr-interestingness.html">people are already trying to game it</a>.
