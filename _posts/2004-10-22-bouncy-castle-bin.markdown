I meant to share this with the world:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dominicsayers/851003/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/851003_d9a37c12af_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Updraught" /></a>

It's the liner in my bin caught in the updraught from the air con. It was a shame to put stuff in there, but ars brevis.
