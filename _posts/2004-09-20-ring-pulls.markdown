I'll tell you what was weird about <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dominicsayers/sets/4670/">Dubai</a>: the ring pulls. It wasn't as if the cans were made by an old manufacturing process. No, the cans were thin extruded aluminium like UK ones. But the ring pulls were the old kind that come off on your finger and get collected by Blue Peter to give homeless children free donkey rides.

Why?
