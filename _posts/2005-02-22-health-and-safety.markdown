Three flakes of snow fell on Heathrow this afternoon, followed by a profound
thaw.

As a result of this the Health and Safety nazis have decreed that each plane
must be visited by the de-icing machine before it can depart. There is one
such machine and it takes about 20 minutes to do a plane. This at an airport
where an aeroplane is scheduled to take off every 2 minutes or so.

I have now been sitting on this plane, still at it's departure gate, for an
hour. There is no sign of the de-icing machine. There is no sign of any ice
either, of course, but that doesn't seem to matter.

I will continue to report from Kafka-land as long as I can stay sane.
