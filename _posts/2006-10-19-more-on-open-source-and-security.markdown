Now <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/evote/1,71957-0.html">Wired</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20061018/095042.shtml">TechDirt</a> have chimed in on the <a target="_blank" href="http://dominicsayers.wordpress.com/2006/10/19/the-economist-on-open-source-and-security/">same</a> theme, that voting machines can only be acknowledged to be secure if the source code for their software is publically available.

This isn't quite the same as open source, of course. They are not suggesting that the code should be publically changeable.

Wired makes the valid point that scrutiny of the source code ought to be (and quite possibly is) a constitutional right.

Also I didn't know that Australia had already done this two years ago.
