My next <a target="_blank" href="http://technorati.com/tag/NewTailBlog">NewTailBlog</a> is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/">City of Sound</a>. With a Technorati rank of 10,725 it's not exactly obscure but I think it deserves some additional recognition outside its milieu.

The author, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2002/01/about_cityofsou.html">Dan Hill</a>, is one of the clever people behind the BBC's <a target="_blank" href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/">reinvention </a>of itself as a (free) digital media provider. In his blog he talks about architecture, design, music and general stuff he's interested in. To me it seems like he puts a bit more effort into his posts than most people (me for instance :-)), they are usually well-constructed and slightly longer than the average blog.

His recent post about binge-watching of DVD box sets is worth reading in its entirety, especially the little gem in his last sentence.
