For people who listen to Tom Waits's stuff, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39683/Interview_Interview_Tom_Waits">here</a> is an unusually open interview. He's a bit of an enigma. Most of what he says in interviews is made up, so don't take any of this at face value. As he says, "There is no such thing as nonfiction".
