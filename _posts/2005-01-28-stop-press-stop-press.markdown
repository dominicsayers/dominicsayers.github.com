I found news of another <a href="https://www.jazzreview.com/cdreview.cfm?ID=8354">Dominic Sayers</a> who is supposedly a saxophonist in the band The Motet in Boulder, Colorado. However I believe the reviewer has the name wrong as the band's website lists a Dominic Lalli and a Garrett Sayers in the line-up. Conflation alert!

Phew.
