I haven't posted about critters for a while. Here is a scary one I found in my garden a couple of weeks ago (the beast was as big as my thumb):

I thought it might be some kind of notifiable pest so I took a few photos of it.

Turns out it is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/gardens/guide/atoz/c/cockchafer.asp">Cockchafer</a> and fairly common. First time I've seen one though. And I wouldn't fancy one flying into me at dusk thanks very much.

Thanks to Rob for identifying it. Here are all its friends and relations on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/cockchafer/interesting/">Flickr</a>.
