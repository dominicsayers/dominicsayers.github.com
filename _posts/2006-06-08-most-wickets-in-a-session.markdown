I have been unable to find out whether <a href="https://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/player/49636.html" target="_blank">Muttiah Muralitharan</a>&#39;s <a href="https://content-usa.cricinfo.com/engvsl/engine/match/225266.html" target="_blank">astonishing spell</a> on Monday after lunch is any kind of record. Six wickets in a session by a single bowler in a Test Match? Can&#39;t have happened very often since wickets were covered.

If anybody knows a way of comparing this spell with others in history I would be interested to know. I have <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/stump_bearders/default.stm" target="_blank">asked Bill Frindall</a> but no reply yet.
