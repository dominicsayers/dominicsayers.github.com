I've decided to separate my thoughts on the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 to another channel: <a href="https://www.thisisnotariot.org" target="_blank">This is not a riot</a>

I think it's OK to mix up a bit of cricket whimsy in with more technical posts about software development and social media, but religion and politics should probably be somewhere else.

For the record, I believe that the late decision to add the words "a constable" to <a href="https://icanhaz.com/ukcoppix" target="_blank">Section 76 of the Act</a> was a serious error. Most police officers are fair, honest and responsible. A very small minority sometimes aren't. It is essential that members of the public can produce evidence of police misconduct on the rare occasions when it happens. The Act gives the power to any constable to prevent documentation of his actions and that is wrong.

That's all I have to say on the subject in this place.
