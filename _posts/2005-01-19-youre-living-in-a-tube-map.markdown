Check out <a href="https://www.tubemap.org/">https://www.tubemap.org/</a>

Click on a station on the tube map and you will see pictures of the station and its surroundings. If there aren't any there yet for that station then go and take some pictures and upload them.

The stated aim of the site is for people to visit a station they don't normally use and document it photographically. But the framework of the site is so natural that people are uploading pictures of their local station because it's a nice thing to do.

A neat resource is emerging.
