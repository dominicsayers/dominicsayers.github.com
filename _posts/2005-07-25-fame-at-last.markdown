You wait ages for your name to be linked to international cricket, and then it is: twice. However I would rather change places with <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/cricket/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=cricket/05/07/23/CRICKET_Yorkshire_Nightlead.html">Joe Sayers</a> than <a href="https://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,16035266-2,00.html">Laura Sayers.</a>
