Don't let Microsoft Update or Windows Update install the Ideacom Technology - Input - HID Touch Screen (PS/2) driver on your PC. If you do, it will replace your mouse driver and your mouse will not work.

This update is offered as Optional but there is no indication of what it will do to a PC that doesn't have a touch screen that uses this driver. To avoid seeing it in the future, right-click on the update and choose "Hide Update".

If you have installed this update and your system is hosed then bad luck. You will need to find out how to drive Windows without a mouse. Try the following keystrokes to get you to Driver Manager:

<strong>Ctrl+Esc</strong>: Same as clicking the Windows Start button (bottom left corner of your screen)

<strong>Alt+Tab</strong>: this will let you choose which window or application you want to control from the keyboard

<strong>Tab</strong>: this will let you choose which button or input field you want to control

<strong>Enter</strong>: this will click the default button

<strong>Space</strong>: this will select and deselect a check box

<strong>Alt+letter</strong>: this will click the button which has 'letter' underlined. i.e. If you press Alt and you see an underscore under the letter N on the button you want to press, then press N while keeping the Alt key pressed.

Use these keystrokes to uninstall the touchscreen driver. If you are offered the chance to delete the driver then accept it gratefully.

Good luck.

p.s. The name of this post comes from a popular saying about Disney Corp. I can't find any attribution for this phrase and it's not as common on Google as I would have guessed. Any idea who first said it?
