The Livery bar in Wood Street, London EC2 has finally responded to my <a href="https://blog.dominicsayers.com/2006/08/17/the-most-expensive-pint-in-london/">outrage</a> at its prices. Under the new policy it no longer charges a staggering £4.60 for a bottle of Magners. Now it's a much more reasonable £4.70.
