There is no point in depending on security through obscurity. It is possible to build a secure system even though everybody knows how it works.

In this context, I also believe it should be a constitutional right for Americans to be able to see the code for the voting machines that register their electoral votes. If such machines are introduced in my country I will not use one until I have independent assurance that they are fair and secure.
