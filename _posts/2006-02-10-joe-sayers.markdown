Further to <a href="https://dominicsayers.blogspot.com/2005/11/flickr-goodness.html">my discovery of Joe Sayers last year</a>, by an amazing coincidence I was in a Pub in York last weekend and noticed behind Sam's head a large print depicting a famous boxing match between a local Kent champion and visiting American Joe Sayers.

WIll return and buy (or at least photograph) the print as soon as possible, but I had neither money nor camera with me at the time.
