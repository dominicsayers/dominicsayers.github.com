Zach Braff demonstrates that first movies, like first novels, tend to be a hotch potch of things the auteur wants to get off his chest. That doesn't make it a bad movie but there are plenty of ideas that don't really go anywhere. This is better than too few ideas of course but, for instance, we are introduced at length to Sam's half-brother Titembay who says Hi and then just disappears out of the movie after one more line.

I found it hard to sustain a belief that somebody could suddenly come off a lifetime of anti-depressants with so few clinical symptoms.

Ian Holm proves that you don't have to nail the accent to give a compelling performance.

3/5
