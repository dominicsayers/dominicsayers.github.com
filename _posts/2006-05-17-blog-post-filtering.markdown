I agree with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/16/feedrinse_filters_fo.html">Cory Doctorow</a> for once. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.feedrinse.com">Feed Rinse</a> is great. Feed filtering should be built into your aggregator.

My €0.02, which is why I'm posting rather than just adding the link to del.icio.us, is from my standpoint as an evangelist for a corporate aggregator. If you're consuming internal feeds (i.e. feeds from your intranet) then you can't use a separate, external third-party filter.

If you're consuming secured feeds (feeds that start with with "https://") then you can't add an external filter into the data flow without moving all your authentication credentials into the filter service.

 It <strong>has</strong> to be built into the aggregator.
