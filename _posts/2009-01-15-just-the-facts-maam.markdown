In my mind I can picture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Montalban" target="_blank">Ricardo Montalban</a> as a regular member of the cast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginian_(TV_series)" target="_blank">The Virginian</a>. Which just goes to show what a poorly-calibrated instrument my mind is.Â Turns out he was only in three episodes, and played a different character in each. What I am remembering, after some Wikipedia research, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darrow" target="_blank">Henry Darrow</a> in The High Chaparral. Different actor, different fictitious ranch. Puerto-Rican, not Mexican.

Another cherished illusion bites the dust. One day I'll only have the facts left. Not looking forward to it.
