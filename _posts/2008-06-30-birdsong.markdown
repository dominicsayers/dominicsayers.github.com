Years ago, when Classic FM was first starting up, they did some test transmissions on the newÂ frequency. I happened to tune in one day while driving. The test transmission was simply a recording of birdsong in woodland. Wow. I didn't listen to another radio station in my car until the proper Classic FM programming started. Obviously I tuned away pretty darn quick at that point. Henry Kelly. Enough said.

Fiddling with a DAB radio at home yesterday I happened upon a digital station called Birdsong. Yay! It's the same recording I think. I cannot recommend this station highly enough. It's incredibly calming to hear the sounds of the countryside when you're sitting in an office surrounded by technology.

Do try it.
