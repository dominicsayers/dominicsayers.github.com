title: Eyebrow-raising Firefox problem

I've come across a problem with a website I'm developing. My nifty code works fine for all browsers except Firefox. Yes, that's right - Firefox fails to render the page as intended but Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera all work fine.

I've put a demonstration of the problem <a title="Firefox problem" href="http://dev.dominicsayers.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I'm surprised that Firefox behaves so differently from other browsers. We all know which browsers we think are non-standards-compliant. If I'd been posting this about an Internet Explorer behaviour then I wouldn't have expected any surprise or sympathy. But Firefox. I'm getting cramp in my eyebrows - they've been permanently raised since I discovered this.

I'm hoping there's a way I can code round the problem. The latest version of Firefox (3.0.2) still exhibits this odd behaviour.
