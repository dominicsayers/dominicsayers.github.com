I can't get decent 802.11x wireless reception in my house, even with base stations on each floor. Nor can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.accidental-light.com/?p=174">Malcolm</a>. Nor can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/06/philips_interference.html">David Pescovitz</a>. I can't get a baby monitor to work reliably unless I position it outside the baby's room in which case it's kind of redundant.

But my DECT phone handsets work fine anywhere in the house from a single base station. They work in the garden and half way down the street (not that I walk down the street talking on the phone very often but I sometimes take a handset round to a neighbour's house and it works fine).

Looks like the Philips DECT baby monitor is <a target="_blank" href="http://shopping.kelkoo.co.uk/ctl/do/search?siteSearchQuery=scd489&amp;fromform=true">available</a> in the UK, so I'm quite excited about that although it is quite pricey.

Can somebody please explain why DECT works so well compared to other technologies? And if there is a technical reason why DECT is better, why can't somebody produce an 802.11x over DECT network?
