According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7232661.stm">BBC</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury has just said in an interviewÂ "there's one law for everybody... I think that's a bit of a danger". He was talking about the introduction of Sharia Law for certain classes of litigation and for certain litigants (Muslims presumably).

Personally I'm not convinced. There's a very good reason for justice to be blind. Good enough for that to be the statue on top of the Old Bailey. Introducing a different legal system for a particular subgroup seems to me to be the danger, not the concept of "one law for everybody".

I fully support the Archbish's right to talk about these issues and he's not a stupid man. And I'm sure the quote was taken slightly out of context (just as I have done here, I suppose). But I'm a strong believer in demonstrating that something is really broken before you decide to fix it. The principle of one law for everybody has stood the test of a considerable amount of time.
