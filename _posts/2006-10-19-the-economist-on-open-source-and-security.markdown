<p>I haven't yet attempted to support my belief that <a href="http://dominicsayers.wordpress.com/2006/09/11/beliefs-5-open-source-code-is-the-only-secure-code/" target="_blank">open source code is the only secure code</a>, it remains a postulate. External support comes not just from <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/the_problem_wit.html" target="_blank">Bruce Schneier</a> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/how-to-steal-an-election-with-a-diebold-machine-200693.php" target="_blank">et alii</a> but this week also from The Economist. Unfortunately the online version of the article is hidden behind a paywall, but if you happen to be a subscriber then check it out <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RDNRGDR" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It's only a sentence at the end of the article, and I'm not sure the writer has any particular authority on the subject, but hey, it's The Economist :-)
