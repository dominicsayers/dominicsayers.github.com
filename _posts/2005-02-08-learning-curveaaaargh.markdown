A learning curve refers to the increased rate of production as a workforce acquires familiarity with a new process.

IT IS NOT A SYNONYM FOR A LEARNING PROCESS

If you mean it is difficult to take the first few steps in a new career and then it becomes progressively easier then OK, that's an analogy with a learning curve and I permit you to use the phrase.

If you just mean it's difficult because you're new then say so. Tosser.
