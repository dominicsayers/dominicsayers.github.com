<table>	<tr>		<!-- Your Description -->		<td>Sunset reflected in Plantation House in Fenchurch Street. You can also see the shadow of The Monument just to the right of the sun. If you had supervision you could also see the London Eye but it's not very clear. This was more specacular in real life with a double sun reflection in the inner and outer layers of glass.</td>		<!-- The Image &amp; -->		<!-- Image Title, Uploaded by -->		<td>			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dominicsayers/1261670/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/1261670_ca5dda47c4_m.jpg" alt=""/></a>
