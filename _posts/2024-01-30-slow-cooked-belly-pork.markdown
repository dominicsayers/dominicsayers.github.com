<!--excerpt.start-->
A rich dish of twice-cooked pork belly in a spicy sauce.
<!--excerpt.end-->

I served this at my 60th birthday party dinner and it all got eaten. Maybe I didn't cook enough, or maybe it was so delicious people couldn't bear to leave any. Who knows.

The point about it is that the pork belly is cooked twice. Once in a slow cooker to render the fat and make it tender enough to fall apart. Then it is glazed and roasted to add yet more flavour.

There are a lot of ingredients; most of them are optional. This is just a record of how I did it on one occasion. You do you.
