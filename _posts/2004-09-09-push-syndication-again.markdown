Further to my post about <a href="http://dominicsayers.blogspot.com/2004/07/syndication-over-jabber.html">using jabber to mediate syndication</a> and avoid all that nasty polling, here is a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/9/5/124516/6906">debate on kur05hin</a> about this very subject. I can see both sides of the argument, but some of the antis are saying that push is wrong because its too difficult to set up and RSS/Atom is all about publishing for the common man. This is correct, but there's no reason we can't support both push and pull. The big popular sites can get pushed to a cache or proxy and the little sites can just get pulled occasionally. Or am I missing something again?
