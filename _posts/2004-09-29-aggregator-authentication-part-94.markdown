<p>Good news this time. I installed <a href="http://www.intravnews.com">intraVnews</a> and it actually authenticated with one of our corporate secured news feeds (from a Microsoft Sharepoint Server site that has <a href="http://www.bluedoglimited.com">Bluedog</a>'s <a href="http://www.bluedoglimited.com/Downloads/pages/SyndicationGenerator.aspx">Syndication Generator</a> installed).</p>
<p>I tried the same feed with both <a href="http://newsgator.com/">NewsGator </a>and <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com">NewzCrawler </a>and neither could be configured to authenticate with the feed :-(</p>
<p>intraVnews is a Microsoft Outlook-based aggregator and I would prefer a stand-alone client. But beggars can't be choosers in this situation.
