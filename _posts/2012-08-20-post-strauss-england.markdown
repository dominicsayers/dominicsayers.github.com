Assuming Andrew Strauss resigns the captaincy after the current Test and chooses not to tour this winter, my team for the first Test in Ahmedabad in November would be as follows:

1. Alastair Cook*
2. Joe Root
3. Jonathan Trott
4. Ian Bell
5. James Taylor
6. Jonny Bairstow
7. Matt Priorâ€ 
8. Stuart Broad
9. Graeme Swann
10. James Anderson
11. Steven Finn

And the rest of the first-class squad:

12. James Tredwell
13. Graham Onions
14. Eoin Morgan
15. Tim Bresnan

Not 100% fit (mentally or physically) so not included: Ravi Bopara, Chris Tremlett

Unlucky: Monty Panesar, Chris Woakes, Samit Patel, Nick Compton

A bit boring and predictable for me, but I think that's a testament to the good stuff coming from Andy Flower and Geoff Miller.
