Well it's been a poor six weeks of progress since my last update. I had a two-week holiday in Tobago to plough through some of these but very little got read. The moral of the story is: don't take a two-year-old on holiday if you want to do any serious reading.

I started The Mythical Man Month, but found its content a bit old-hat - not surprising considering how long it has been since it was written. I can see how revelatory it might have been thirty years ago. Brooks is a bit fond of his biblical imagery and parables for my taste; it's sometimes difficult to resolve a rational approach with such a faith-based outlook on life, but wiser people than me have managed it I suppose.

Unfortunately the list has got longer as well. I realised that two corporate sagas needed to be included: Barbarians At The Gate (about the takeover of RJR Nabisco) and The Smartest Guys In The Room (about Enron) are definite must-have-reads.
