I don't know whether <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/">TechDirt</a> is affiliated with <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, but Mike <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20040928/076227.shtml">gives a puff</a> to Bloglines's selfless attempt to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/services/">reduce syndication bandwidth usage by caching the feeds itself</a>.

It might be a reasonable approach to public feeds if the business model is right (and I would put up with a *few* ads along with my news). For private feeds it's less of a problem because by their very nature the private feeds are less frequently used. However it would be a shame if two standards emerged: the only difference between public and private feeds should be the authentication.
