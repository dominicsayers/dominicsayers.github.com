--></style>Much has been said and written about cricket's Decision Review System (DRS) in the last few weeks. About 95.3% of what has been said is total rubbish. But it is time to take stock of what we've learned about the DRS, where's going and how cricket can make the best use of the available technology to improve the spectacle for its paying customers.

I'll publish this in sections - it's turned out to be a bit longer than I thought...
