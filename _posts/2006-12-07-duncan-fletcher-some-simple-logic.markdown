Lets assume that Duncan Fletcher doesn't do anything out of the box, like picking two spinners for the next Test Match in Perth. Or none for that matter. He is wedded to the one spinner formula like English football is wedded to the 4-4-2 formation.

There is good reason to think he will stick with one spinner because he doesn't have a captain with the imagination to use two spinners. Nor does he have a seam bowling attack that is fully fit or can bowl its overs fast enough to avoid a fine, which rules out the all-seam option.

So one spinner it will be. And it won't be Jamie Dalrymple, or Michael Vaughan, or, Lord help us, Kevin Pietersen. Even though they can all turn the ball further than Ashley Giles.

It will be Giles or Panesar. If it is Panesar then Anderson may lose his place to Mahmood to strengthen the batting. It could hardly weaken the bowling. Whatever, we are not concerned with the seamers today.

There are thus four logical outcomes. Here I analyse what is likely to happen to Fletcher if these outcomes happen:

1. Fletcher picks Panesar. Panesar bowls well and takes wickets. Fletcher looks like a chump for not picking him in the first two tests. Fletcher has to resign.

2. Fletcher picks Panesar. Panesar gets no wickets, drops a couple of easy catches and bags a pair. Fletcher looks weak for bowing to popular pressure. Fletcher has to resign.

3. Fletcher picks Giles again. Giles again fails to take wickets. The clamour for Panesar gets even more deafening and Fletcher receives massive criticism from all quarters for his stubbornness. Fletcher has to resign.

4. Fletcher picks Giles again. Giles gets two 50s, bowls like a hero and wins the match for England. Fletcher survives.

The only outcome that sees Fletcher surviving is number 4. The least likely one, frankly. Goodbye, Dunc.
