In a sure sign that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace </a>is past its peak I got myself a space. Rupert: if you're reading this I should sell now mate. In my defence, one reason I had not really looked at MySpace until now is that the site is blocked by the internet police where I work.
