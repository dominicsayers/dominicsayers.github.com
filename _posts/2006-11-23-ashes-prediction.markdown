After listening under the bedclothes to the first day of the 2006 Ashes series from Brisbane, I now confidently predictÂ that England will win the series 5-0

My reasoning? Any team with enough talent to leave out <a href="http://blog.dominicsayers.com/2006/08/10/monty-panesar-part-2/">Monty Panesar</a> must be world beaters. How can we lose?
