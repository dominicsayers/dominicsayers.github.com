Over two and a half thousand people have now signed up to the <a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/goldanthem/">petition</a> to replace the British national anthem with 'Gold' by Spandau Ballet (thanks for the heads-up, <a target="_blank" href="http://mushysmumblings.wordpress.com/">Mushy</a>).

It turns out this is one of the more sensible issues raised on the Prime Minister's admirable E-Petitions site. Somehow it got through the net that filtered out a <a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/pirate-talk/">petition</a> to make "Talk Like A Pirate Day" a national holiday. Arrr.

Many of the others are issues of national importance only if you live somewhere like <a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/iceskating/">Leicester</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/Turnhamgreen/">Turnham Green</a>.

Among the nimbyism and <a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/CULTURES/">illiterate</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/StrikesIllegal/">Colonel Blimpery</a> are a scattering of eccentrics campaigning for, among other things,

<a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/InForTheHighJump/">Making the high jump compulsory</a>
<a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/whiteroofs/">Asking the Prime Minister to paint all the roofs in Britain white</a>
<a target="_blank" href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/Philosophy-Edu/">Teaching Philosophy to infants</a>

There is a lot that is good about the E-Petition site, including the fact that the underlying software is open source and that the site is produced in association with the people behind <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">http://www.theyworkforyou.com</a>. But the best thing is the nutters.

Can you guess which of the above petitions I added my name to?
