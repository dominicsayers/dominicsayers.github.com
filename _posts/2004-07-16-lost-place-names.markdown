English is a dynamic language and most people now seem to think this is
greatly to its advantage. That doesn't mean we can't occasionally mourn the
passing of a part of our language.

The victims in this case (there are two) are place names.

Chiltern Railways announcers: please note the station is called Princes
Risborough (i.e. Prince's Risborough), not Princess Risborough, tempting
though it is to think of such a fairytale character.

London Underground announcers: nobody really knows why the area is called
Marylebone, but it definitely wasn't named after anybody called Marley (as
in Marleybone). OK, it's an anagram of the real name, but then so is Be
Normal Len.
