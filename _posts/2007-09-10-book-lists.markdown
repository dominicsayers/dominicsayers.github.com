I've been using <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers">del.icio.us</a> to manage my reading lists (I still have some minor issues with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/DominicSayers">LibraryThing</a>). You may have noticed the links on the right of this page.

Having now finished <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2weAAAACAAJ">The Long Tail</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v9p9AAAACAAJ">Barbarians At The Gate</a> the list of <em>Books I Should Have Read</em> is starting to look manageable. I'm considering whether to add <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rVaLAAAACAAJ">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> to the list, but I fear I will have a similar reaction to <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WFh3AAAACAAJ">No Logo</a> (which I ended up hurling across the room). This is malice aforethought, though. I will add it and start it and only abandon it if it confirms my prejudice.

State of play:
Books I should have read: <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/booksishouldhaveread%2Bunread">still unread</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/booksishouldhaveread%2Breadit">now under my belt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/booksishouldhaveread%2Babandoned">abandoned</a>
Books I have been recommended to read: <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/bookstoread%2Bunread">still unread</a>,Â <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/dominicsayers/bookstoread%2Bminusvote">warned off</a>.

I'm not doing book reviews here because there are better places to put them, but I heartily recommend both The Long Tail and Barbarians At The Gate. I liked The Long Tail because it actually contains some supporting evidence for its theories (unlike <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wEaDAAAACAAJ">The Tipping Point</a> which seemed to be based entirely on anecdotes). I liked Barbarians At The Gate because I like thrillers and I haven't read one for a while. The fact that the events actually happened just makes it more gripping.
