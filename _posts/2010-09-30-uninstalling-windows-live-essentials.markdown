I tried to uninstall Windows Live Essentials. The uninstaller ran fine and looked like it was doing everything it should. But the damn thing wouldn't go away.

Google.

43,000 people having the same problem as me.

Search microsoft.com, live.com, msdn.com. Nothing, of course.

Here's what I did to get rid of it:

1. Downloaded the installer from <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials</a>

2. Ran it

3. Chose Repair

4. Rebooted

5. Uninstalled

Obvious really. But hopefully the next 43,000 people will find some useful information here instead of 43,000 blind alleys.
