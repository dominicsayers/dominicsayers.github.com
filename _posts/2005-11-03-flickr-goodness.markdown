The advantage of having a relatively uncommon surname is I can easily keep track of my family's goings-on by, for example, subscribing to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/sayers/">all Flickr photos tagged with Sayers</a>. I wouldn't recommend this approach if you were called, say, Malcolm Dick.

Using the magic of RSS I get notified whenever anybody posts a photo tagged with Sayers. This works a treat for me and throws up the odd surprise too. Today somebody posted a photo of a boxer called Tom Sayers, of whom I had never heard before. Does he look like me? <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/snakeblocker/59262385/">You be the judge.</a>
