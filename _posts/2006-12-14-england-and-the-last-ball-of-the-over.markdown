It was Vic Marks who very perceptively spotted that England are prone to losing wickets from the last ball of an over:
<blockquote>"One oddity: seven of England's batsmen were out to the last ball of the over. Something else to work on there."

I note for the record that the first two England wickets of this test match have also fallen to the last ball of the over. I predict this will become a major talking point, and Vic Marks may have a point here. Well done, sir.
