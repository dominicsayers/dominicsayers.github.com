There is another lesser-known blog I want to write about, but the latest post has started a train of research that I haven't finished following up yet. I have a day job...

I note that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-1825.cfm">Fimoculous</a> has published a list of 30 lesser-known blogs that he recommends. I have added this listÂ to my del.icio.us links with a tag of <a target="_blank" href="https://del.icio.us/tag/NewTailBlog">NewTailBlog</a>.

Which leads me to the suggestion that, if you are following Confused of Calcutta's <a target="_blank" href="https://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/11/20/newtailblog/">idea</a> of tagging your "minor" blog recommendations with the <a target="_blank" href="https://technorati.com/tag/newtailblog">NewTailBlog</a> tag, you should also link to them in del.icio.us (or your favourite link aggregator) with the same tag. I have done so with my two recommendations so far.
