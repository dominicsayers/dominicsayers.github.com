I believe Flash has a place in the world, just not on most of the websites it gets used on. It's easy to criticise when it is used inappropriately, but I prefer to celebrate those rare occasions when it is exactly the right medium for the message.

Here is one of the better uses of Flash I have seen: <a href="https://www.pentagonstrike.co.uk/pentagon.htm">Pentagon Strike</a> - what actually hit the Pentagon on 9/11 and where did the Boeing 757 go?
