Not a real tour, just hypothetical.

<strong>First XI</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Rogers</li>
	<li>Warner</li>
	<li>Bell</li>
	<li>Pietersen</li>
	<li>Clarke *</li>
	<li>Watson</li>
	<li>Haddin â€ </li>
	<li>Swann</li>
	<li>Siddle</li>
	<li>Harris</li>
	<li>Anderson</li>
</ol>
<strong>Rest of the squad</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Cook</li>
	<li>Root</li>
	<li>Bairstow</li>
	<li>Broad</li>
	<li>Bresnan</li>
	<li>Tremlett</li>
</ul>
<strong>Seven Aussies in the first team</strong>

Yep. I think Rogers is a marginal choice over Cook but it's my team so I'm picking him. All the subs are English, although again Bairstow was a marginal pick over Khawaja. Nobody making a cast iron case for this spot though.

<strong>No Prior?</strong>

Bairstow is the reserve keeper and in slightly better form with the bat.

<strong>Broad not in the first team?</strong>

No.

<strong>And Tremlett? He didn't even play.</strong>

The other candidates rules themselves out by playing. Onions was unlucky.
