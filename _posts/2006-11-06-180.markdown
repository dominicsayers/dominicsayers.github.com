In February, the Sex Pistols turned down an invitation to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. "Were not coming. Your not paying attention" is the authentic voice of Mr Johnny Rotten. Would be good <a target="_blank" href="http://gapingvoid.com/">on the back of a business card</a>.

I have decided to use the phrase "outside the shit-stem" as often as I can in future.
