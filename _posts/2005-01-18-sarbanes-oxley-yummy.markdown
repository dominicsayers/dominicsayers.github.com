Sarbanes-Oxley is a poorly-drafted and hastily-passed piece of American legislation with which my European company must comply in order to retain its NYSE listing.

It has been seized on by Audit departments in multinational organisations around the world as a lever to increase the frequency and depth of audits into our systems. In some cases this will lead to better, safer and more reliable systems. In all cases it will lead to more expensive systems and longer development cycles as we comply with all the documentation and procedural requirements of the Act.

I thank you.
