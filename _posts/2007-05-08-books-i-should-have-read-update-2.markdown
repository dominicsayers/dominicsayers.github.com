OK, here's where I stand on my background task of catching up on the books everybody else claims to have read.

<strike>1. </strike><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349113467/qid=1144307770/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/026-4754653-6799626"><font color="#3388cc"><strike>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</strike></font></a><strike>, Malcolm Gladwell</strike>  (just finished this on my way back from holiday in Spain. Still pondering what I think of it, but at least I can now say with hand on heart that I have actually read it. Good holiday read if nothing else, not too taxing)
2. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141014598/qid=1144307770/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/026-4754653-6799626"><font color="#3388cc">Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</font></a>, Malcolm Gladwell

4. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cathedral-Bazaar-Eric-S-Raymond/dp/0596001088/sr=8-1/qid=1163756617/ref=sr_1_1/203-3345198-4683111?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><font color="#3388cc">The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</font></a>, Eric S. Raymond
5. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Month-Essays-Software-Engineering/dp/0201835959/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-7135899-3517402?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178631915&amp;sr=8-1">The Mythical Man Month</a>, Frederick P. Brooks (purchased but not opened yet)
6. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Liars-Poker-Playing-Money-Markets/dp/0340767006/sr=8-1/qid=1165311738/ref=pd_ka_1/026-0747662-7951651?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><font color="#3388cc">Liar’s Poker</font></a>, Michael Lewis (under way, again easy reading)

I have had some recommendations from friends and colleagues for which I am very grateful. Thanks Jonathan, Steve and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.accidental-light.com/">Malcolm</a>. I've added Jonathan's to the list because it met all my criteria. Steve and Malcolm's I will add to another list:

<strong>Books I have been recommended to read
</strong>1.<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/055277331X/ref=pd_bowtega_2/202-7135899-3517402?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178632568&amp;sr=1-2">The God Delusion</a>, Richard Dawkins (now in paperback I see)
2. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tricks-Mind-Derren-Brown/dp/1905026269/sr=8-1/qid=1164363507/ref=pd_ka_1/202-3128449-7279029?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><font color="#3388cc">Tricks of the Mind</font></a>, Derren Brown

I like the sound of both of them and will do my best to get to them in time. Come on, there must be more non-fiction classics I haven't thought of yet - what have I missed?
