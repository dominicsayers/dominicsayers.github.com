Nothing to do with health and safety this time. I'm sitting in a departure
lounge - we were *just* about to board when they announced there would be no
movements for about 45 minutes.

The reason? Mr Bush has decided to leave Frankfurt about now so he takes
priority.

I can see Air Force One across the other side of the airfield. It just looks
like a plane. Everything is grey at that distance in this weather.
