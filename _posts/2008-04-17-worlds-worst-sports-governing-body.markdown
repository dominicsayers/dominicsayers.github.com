I have in mind a post about various governing bodies of world sport, comparing them to see which is the worst. Every time I sit down to write it, another governing body makes a spectacular arse of itself in some way and puts me back to square one.

The obvious candidates are these (in no particular order at the moment):
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Federation International de l'Automobile</strong> (<a href="https://fia.com" target="_blank">FIA</a>). <a href="https://news.google.co.uk/news?q=max+mosley+scandal" target="_blank">Max Mosley</a>. nuff said. But the historical track record of the FIA is not good either, having been in Bernie Ecclestone's pocket for a long time (for sound financial reasons of course).</li>
	<li>Any international governing body of professional boxing (e.g. <a href="https://www.ibamensboxing.com/" target="_blank">IBA</a>, <a href="https://www.internationalboxingcouncil.com/index.html" target="_blank">IBC</a>, <a href="https://www.ibf-usba-boxing.com/" target="_blank">IBF</a>, <a href="https://www.iboboxing.com/" target="_blank">IBO</a>, <a href="https://www.ibuboxing.com/" target="_blank">IBU</a>, <a href="https://www.wbaonline.com/" target="_blank">WBA</a>, <a href="https://www.wbcboxing.com/" target="_blank">WBC</a>, <a href="https://www.wpbf-usbc.org/" target="_blank">WPBF</a>, <a href="https://www.worldboxingfoundation.com/wbf/" target="_blank">WBF</a>, <a href="https://www.wbo-int.com/" target="_blank">WBO</a>, <a href="https://www.wbu.cc/" target="_blank">WBU</a>). It's not a crime for a sport to have many governing bodies, but to have so many ineffectual ones that have no interest in the participants' welfare is remarkable.</li>
	<li>The <strong>International Olympic Commission</strong> (<a href="https://www.olympic.org" target="_blank">IOC</a>). Has there been another governing body whose members are so willing to be induced?</li>
	<li>Oh yes, the <strong>Fédération Internationale de Football Association</strong> (<a href="https://www.fifa.com/" target="_blank">FIFA</a>). The rot starts at the top.</li>
	<li>And so we come to the <strong>International Cricket Council</strong> (<a href="https://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">ICC</a>). Supine in the face of political awkwardness and dominated by self-interest, this organisation is ill-equipped to govern a rapidly-changing sport.</li>
</ul>
So there's a lot to write about, and my thoughts are not really in order yet. This pilot post is to ask if anybody can answer the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>Is there a world governing body that does a good job, i.e. acts in the long-term interest of the sport without favouring any subset of its exponents?</li>
	<li>Have I missed any obvious bodies from my initial list?</li>
</ol>
Answers on a postcard.
