Plenty of noise going on about the economics of abundance - the notion that Keynesian laws of supply and demand don't work very well in the limiting case where supply is effectively infinite. I'm not sure anybody has the answer yet, but I'm assuming there is an Einstein out there who can challenge the Newtonian weltanschauung we are all suffering from.

I came up with the phrase "quantum economics" to describe this shift in thinking. Then I thought I bet somebody has thought of that before. Indeed, here is the definitive text on <a target="_blank" href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Economics">Quantum Economics</a>.

So, here is my reading list at the moment:

<strong>Chris Anderson</strong>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/11/more_on_the_eco.html">More on the economics of abundance</a>

<strong>John Walker</strong>

This was written in 1988 by the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walker_(programmer)">man who wrote AutoCAD</a> but it seems to be incredibly prescient. He also uses the phrase "quantum economics".

A lot to read and take in, but maybe there is the beginning of an idea in there?
