## Summary

I am a deeply experienced technologist and technology manager. I've worked in organizations from startups to international investment banks.

My core skills are pushing a project in the best technical direction to ensure early and repeatable successes but I also like to get my hands dirty with code.

## Anthemis Group
### Technology Director (2015-present)

I took Anthemis Group from spreadsheets to an automated investment pipeline supporting multiple portfolios. To do this I built a platform for Anthemis's investment activities allowing us to collate information from many sources into the selection process. Rapid gathering of all available data enables a smooth, automated funnel from initial interest through to Investment Committee documents.

The same platform also supports Anthemis Group's advisory activities, allowing us to efficiently assess and shortlist investment targets on behalf of clients with diverse investment theses.

I integrated Slack, Podio, Evernote, Mailchimp and email into a coherent data flow that allows the Anthemis team to share information efficiently and get notified about actionable changes immediately.

## Xenapto
### CEO (2012-present)

I designed, built and launched the Xenapto platform.

Xenapto is a publicly-available service that manages investment data and integrates modern productivity tools into a flexible workflow. It is used by multiple VCs and individual investors as the core of their investment activity.

I raised Â£550,000 from investors to create Xenapto using Xenapto's own bookbuilding features to manage the capital raise. I won a place on the MassChallenge 2015 accelerator programme in competition with 2,275 startups from 67 countries.

## Consultant
### (2008-2012)

I acted as an independent consultant for a number of financial services institutions in London.

A sample role was as Programme Director for the definition phase of Royal Bank of Scotland's credit exposure consolidation programme, designed to give the bank a 360-degree view of their exposure to a credit event in any given market, country or region. I oversaw the initial contact with the business lines up to the final scoping of the programme before the delivery phase.

## Commerzbank (then Dresdner Kleinwort)
### Global Head of IT, Investment Banking

I oversaw the integration of the Investment Banking IT infrastructure into the Capital Markets equivalents. I halved the Investment Banking IT spend along with a 75% reduction in headcount.

As a result I also acquired other portfolios including Global Head of Desktop Strategy and Global Head of Reference Data. As part of my Desktop Strategy role I oversaw the termination of a global contract with a desktop virtualization provider by agreeing measurable objectives and documenting their failure to deliver against them.

I also led the rollout of IT Service Management practices in the investment bank and was Process Architect for the wider Dresdner Bank IT Service Management project.

Across these multiple briefs I managed 87 people in three global locations.
